**Lab files**: The files for this lab are in the D:\LabFiles\Automate Resources folder.

# Lab overview

The students will take the information gained in the lessons to configure and subsequently implement automate processes within AdventureWorks.

# Lab objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Deploy an Azure resource from a GitHub Quickstart template

- Configure performance metric related notifications

- Deploy an Azure Automation Runbook to perform index maintenance in an Azure SQL Database

# Scenario

You have been hired as a Senior Data Engineer to help automate day to day operations of database administration. This automation is to help ensure that the databases for AdventureWorks continue to operate at peak performance as well as provide methods for alerting based on certain criteria. AdventureWorks utilizes SQL Server in both Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service offerings.

# Exercise 1: Deploy an Azure Quickstart Template 

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

Individual Exercise

The main task for this exercise are as follows:

- Deploy an Azure resource from a GitHub Quickstart template

## Task: Deploy an Azure SQL Database from a template

1. Navigate to the following GitHub using a web browser.

    [https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.sql/sql-database-transparent-encryption-create](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.sql/sql-database-transparent-encryption-create)

    ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated](../images/dp-3300-module-66-lab-05.png)

    Click on azuredeploy.json, and review the file.

2. Navigate back to the above link (click the back arrow in the top left of the browser), and click on the Deploy to Azure button. You may be prompted to login to the Azure portal. Login with your supplied credentials.

3. You will see a screen like the one below. In order to deploy this template, you need to complete the blank fields.

    In the Resource Group field, click “Create New” and type **DP300-Lab06**, and then click OK. Change the region to a region near you. For the remaining fields, use the following values:

	- SQL Administrator Login: **labadmin**
	- SQL Administrator Login Password: **Azur3Pa$$**
	- Transparent Data Encryption: **Enabled**
	- Location: **[resourceGroup().location]**
