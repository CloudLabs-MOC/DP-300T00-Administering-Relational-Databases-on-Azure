# DP-300: Administering Relational Databases on Microsoft Azure

This repository has been decommissioned and is not in use.

To access lab exercises and instructions for Microsoft DP-300 learning content, see [DP-300: Administering Microsoft Azure SQL Solutions](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/dp-300-database-administrator). 

There are seven labs.

## Lab 1 - Using the Azure Portal and SQL Server Management Studio

Students will explore the Azure Portal and use it to create an Azure VM with SQL Server 2019 installed. Then they will connect to the virtual machine through Remote Desktop Protocol and restore a database using SQL Server Management Studio.

## Lab 2 – Deploying PaaS Databases

The student will configure basic resources needed to deploy an Azure SQL Database with a Virtual Network Endpoint. Connectivity to the SQL Database will be validated using Azure Data Studio from the lab VM. Finally, an Azure Database for PostgreSQL will be created.

## Lab 3 – Implement a Secure Environment

The students will take the information gained in the lessons to configure and subsequently implement security in the Azure Portal and within the AdventureWorks database.

## Lab 4 – Monitor and Optimize Resources

The students will take the information gained in the lessons to scope out the deliverables for a digital transformation project within AdventureWorks. Examining the Azure portal as well as other tools, students will determine how to utilize native tools to identify and resolve performance related issues. Finally, students will be able to identify fragmentation within the database as well as learn steps to resolve the issue appropriately.

## Lab 5 -Query Performance Troubleshooting

The students will evaluate a database design for problems with normalization, data type selection and index design. They will run queries with suboptimal performance, examine the query plans, and attempt to make improvements within the AdventureWorks2017 database.

## Lab 6 – Automate Resources

The students will take the information gained in the lessons to configure and subsequently implement automate processes within AdventureWorks.

## Lab 7 – Planning and Implementing a High Availability and Disaster Recovery Environment

The students will execute two main tasks: make Azure SQL Database geo-redundant, and backup to and restore from a URL which uses Azure.

## Notes

When copying code from the lab exercises into the lab Virtual Machine, occasionally line breaks will not come across properly. Please verify that the code is correctly copied before executing it.
